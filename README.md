# reStepper: It steps your steps when the steps you stepped weren't counted by your step counter. 

The future of fitness tracking is here! reStepper is an open-source, arduino-powered machine to walk your fitness tracker after those unfortunate workouts when your steps didn't get logged. Did you have the audacity to take you child for a walk in a stroller? Get those steps back! Were you foolish enough to go swimming when you could have walked in aimless circles around the pool? Don't let the credit drift away! Reckless enough to do something, anything, that might require you to take off your jewelry before working up a sweat? Let the reStepper sweat it all back! Maybe you just don't want third parties to know where you run, or where your secret morel patch is, or how fast they need to make the people harvesting machines in order to catch Charlton Heston. 

The reStepper uses a highly sophisticated algorithm to convert calories burned in a not-steptacular workout into the steps you would have gotten burning those same calories on a light stroll. It works for both men and women thanks to a ridiculously oversized novelty toggle switch. 

## Are you serious?

I mean, not really, obviously (though the reStepper does work exactly as promised). This project exists for two reasons. 1. To push back against a trend towards quantifying everything we do by creating something ridiculous that does it better. And 2. Because this is a more fun way to learn to code in Arduino than just another "Blink LED" tutorial. Building a reStepper will teach you how to read digital rotary encoders and binary switches, output to an LCD, and control a servo. You'll create a basic user interface that takes two forms of inputs and converts that into actions through an algorithm you can tinker with and tune. Use your own fitness tracking data to create a machine custom built for your own activity levels.

And when it starts swinging for the first time, you won't stop laughing.

Isof you want to add some blinking LEDs, there's plenty of room for that, too. 

## Bill of Materials

Note: I use Amazon Affiliate links because the small kickback helps me fund more projects like this, but almost everything can be sourced directly through [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) as well. Some of the items are explicitly necessary (you can use a standard mini-breadboard if you don't want to solder) and some only come in batches, so shop around first. These recommendations don't represent the cheapest prices.
